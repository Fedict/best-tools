# Converter tool

After unzipping the BeST-file, this tool can be used to convert the XML to CSV-files or SHP.
It is possible to select one or more regions: B(russels), F(landers) or W(alloon).

Usage:
`java -jar converter.jar -i <directory_unzipped_xml> -B -F -W`

Note that unzipping the file and converting the XMLs to CSV/SHP may take a few minutes, 
a minimum of 15 GB free disk space is recommended.
